   - Image section with proper aspect ratio
   - Content section below with proper padding

   - Both with proper spacing and positioning

3. **Action Buttons**
   - Link/Share icon (top right)
   - Heart/Favorite icon (top right, below share)
   - Positioned exactly as shown in reference

4. **User Thumbnail**
   - Circular user avatar at bottom right of image section
   - Slightly overlapping the image and content sections
   - With white border and subtle shadow

5. **Content Section**
   - Category badge (colored by category type)
   - Location with pin icon
   - Title with proper sizing and weight
   - Rating with star icon and review count
   - Footer with share icon, delivery info, and price
   - All with proper spacing and alignment

6. **Section Header**

   - Filter tabs below (Popular, Latest, Top Ratings, Trending)
   - Popular tab highlighted with orange background

## Component Structure

The implementation uses:
- A standalone `GigCard.tsx` component for reusability
- CSS styles in `globals.css` to ensure exact visual match
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Font Awesome icons for consistent iconography

## Verification

All elements from the reference image are present in the implementation. The styling has been carefully matched to ensure consistency with:
- Font sizes and weights
- Colors and backgrounds
- Spacing and positioning
- Icon styling and placement
- Hover effects and transitions

No icons or elements are missing from the implementation compared to the reference image.
